# Vehicles-Price-Predictions
The "Cars and Vehicles Price Predictions" project aims to develop a predictive model using simple linear regression to forecast the prices of cars. By implementing a simple linear regression model, the project seeks to establish a relationship between these predictor variables and the target variable, which is the price of the vehicle.
